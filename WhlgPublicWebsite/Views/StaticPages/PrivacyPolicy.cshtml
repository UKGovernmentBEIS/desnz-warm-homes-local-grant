            This notice is provided by the Department for Energy Security and Net Zero and sets out how we will use your personal data, and
            your rights. It is made under Articles 13 and/or 14 of the UK General Data Protection Regulation (UK GDPR).

        <p class="govuk-body">
            This service is for citizens to find out whether they might be eligible for the HUG2 grant and, if they are, to refer them to
            their local authority or their delivery partner. If the local authority is not signed up to the service, or are no longer able to
            accept new referrals, the citizens can consent to submitting their referral to the Local Authority of their delivery partner to
            process under the Warm Homes: Local Grant (WH:LG) scheme. This scheme is the successor to HUG2 and will include support for
            low-income households off the gas grid who are currently eligible for the Home Upgrade Grant:Phase 2 (HUG 2). Delivery for WH:LG will
            begin in Spring 2025.
