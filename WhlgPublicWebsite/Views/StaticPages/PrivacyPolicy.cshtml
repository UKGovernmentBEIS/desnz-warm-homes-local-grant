            This service is for citizens to find out whether they might be eligible for the Warm Homes: Local Grant (WH:LG) and, if they are, to

            WH:LG eligibility criteria to identify homes eligible for support through the programme. This will allow the Local Authority or their
            official contractor to contact you as part of the Warm Homes and Public Sector Decarbonisation Devolution Programme.
